Probability Distributions
Namespace: MathNet.Numerics.Distributions

Continuous Probability Distributions

Continuous probability distributions support both the probability density function (pdf) and the cumulative distribution function (cdf), as well as the usual probability parameters. Additionally, random numbers can be generated based on the configured probability model parameters and some random number source.

All implementations inherit from the public abstract base class ContinuousDistribution and implement both interfaces IContinuousProbabilityDistribution and IContinuousGenerator.

Continuous Uniform Distribution
Triangular Distribution
Standard Distribution (Gaussian)
Normal Distribution (Gaussian with mean and variance)
Lognormal Distribution
Exponential Distribution
Laplace Distribution
Gamma Distribution
Beta Distribution
Student's T Distribution
Fisher Snedecor Distribution
Erlang Distribution
Cauchy Lorentz Distribution
Chi Distribution
ChiSquared Distribution
Pareto Distribution
Stable Distribution
Rayleigh Distribution

Discrete Probability Distributions

Discrete probability distributions support both the probability mass function (pmf) and the cumulative distribution function (cdf), as well as the usual probability parameters. Additionally, random numbers can be generated based on the configured probability model parameters and some random number source.

All implementations inherit from the public abstract base class DiscreteDistribution and implement both interfaces IDiscreteProbabilityDistribution and IDiscreteGenerator.

Discrete Uniform Distribution
Arbitrary Distribution
Bernoulli Distribution
Binomial Distribution
Geometric Distribution
Hypergeometric Distribution
Poisson Distribution
Zipf Distribution

Code Sample

StudentsTDistribution dist = new StudentsTDistribution(2);
double a = dist.Variance;
double b = dist.ProbabilityDensity(1);

Random Sources
Namespace: MathNet.Numerics.RandomSources

All implementations inherit the public abstract base class RandomSource.

System Random Source
Mersenne Twister Random Source
Additive Lagged Fibonacci Random Source
Xor Shift Random Source

If unsure what to choose, we recommend to simply use SystemRandomSource which internally uses the random source provided by the .Net Framework. Note that random sources should be reused, so be careful to create only one instance (per thread) and share it internally.

Code Sample

MersenneTwisterRandomSource src = new MersenneTwisterRandomSource();
StudentsTDistribution dist = new StudentsTDistribution(src);
double a = dist.NextDouble();

Interpolation
Namespace: MathNet.Numerics.Interpolation

Most interpolation algorithms also support numeric differentiation and integration. A facade class Interpolation is provided for easy access, but if needed the algorithms can also be used directly in the Algorithms sub-namespace. All implementations implement the interface IInterpolationMethod.

Rational Pole Free Interpolation, on arbitrary points (Barycentric Algorithm)
Polynomial Interpolation, on arbitrary points (Neville Algorithm)
Polynomial Interpolation, on equidistant points (Barycentric Algorithm)
Polynomial Interpolation, on first kind Chebychev points (Barycentric Algorithm)
Polynomial Interpolation, on second kind Chebychev points (Barycentric Algorithm)
Rational Interpolation, on arbitrary points (with poles; Bulirsch & Stoer Algorithm)
Linear Spline Interpolation, on arbitrary points
Cubic Spline Interpolation, with boundary conditions on arbitrary points
Natural Cubic Spline Interpolation, on arbitrary points
Akima Cubic Spline Interpolation, on arbitrary points
Custom Barycentric Interpolation, based on provided barycentric weights
Custom Spline Interpolation, based on provided spline coefficients
Custom Cubic Hermite Spline Interpolation, based on provided derivatives

If unsure what to choose, we recommend to simply use Interpolation.Create(x,y) which internally uses the barycentric rational pole free interpolation.

Code Sample

double[] t = new double[] { -2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0 };
double[] x = new double[] { 1.0, 2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0 };
IInterpolationMethod method = Interpolation.Create(t, x);
double a = method.Interpolate(-0.5);
